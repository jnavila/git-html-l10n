--signoff::
--no-signoff::
	Add a `Signed-off-by` trailer by the committer at the end of the commit log message. The meaning of a signoff depends on the project to which you're committing. For example, it may certify that the committer has the rights to submit the work under the project's license or agrees to some contributor representation, such as a Developer Certificate of Origin. (See https://developercertificate.org for the one used by the Linux kernel and Git projects.) Consult the documentation or leadership of the project to which you're contributing to understand how the signoffs are used in that project.

A opção --no-signoff pode ser usada para contra-ordenar uma opção --signoff anterior na linha de comando.
