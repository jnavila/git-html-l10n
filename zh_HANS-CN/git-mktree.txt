=============

名称
--
git-mktree - 从 ls-tree 格式化文本构建树对象


概述
--
[verse]
'git mktree' [-z] [--missing] [--batch]

描述
--
Reads standard input in non-recursive `ls-tree` output format, and creates a tree object. The order of the tree entries is normalized by mktree so pre-sorting the input is not required. The object name of the tree object built is written to the standard output.

选项
--
-z::
	读取以 NUL 结尾的 `ls-tree -z` 输出。

--missing::
	Allow missing objects. The default behaviour (without this option) is to verify that each tree entry's hash identifies an existing object. This option has no effect on the treatment of gitlink entries (aka "submodules") which are always allowed to be missing.

--batch::
	Allow building of more than one tree object before exiting. Each tree is separated by a single blank line. The final newline is optional. Note - if the `-z` option is used, lines are terminated with NUL.
