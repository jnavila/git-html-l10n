git-write-tree(1)
=================

名称
--
git-write-tree - 从当前索引创建目录树对象


概述
--
[verse]
'git write-tree' [--missing-ok] [--prefix=<前缀>/]

描述
--
使用当前索引创建一个树对象。新树对象的名称将打印到标准输出中。

索引必须处于完全合并状态。

Conceptually, 'git write-tree' sync()s the current index contents into a set of tree files. In order to have that match what is actually in your directory right now, you need to have done a 'git update-index' phase before you did the 'git write-tree'.


选项
--
--missing-ok::
	Normally 'git write-tree' ensures that the objects referenced by the directory exist in the object database. This option disables this check.

--prefix=<前缀>/::
	Writes a tree object that represents a subdirectory `<prefix>`. This can be used to write the tree object for a subproject that is in the named subdirectory.
